# LightSensor
Log-scale light sensor data collected by ESP8266, sent to MQTT, and transferred to Adafruit.IO.
There are two primary files here: init.lua and ManualMQTTbridge_v01.py. The first is the program 
you need to flash to your ESP8266 board. The second should run on a Raspberry Pi, possibly the
same one on which you are running the MQTT broker.

# Tutorial
This section will be updated when the tutorial for this project is published in the Adafruit
Learning System.
